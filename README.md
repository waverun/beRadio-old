```bash
git clone https://github.com/waverun/beRadio.git
 ``` 
 
3. Open the cloned repository folder, and there you'll find a file with the extension .xcodeproj. Double click on this file to open the project in Xcode.
  
4. With the project open in Xcode, connect your iPhone or iPad to your Mac using a USB cable.
  
5. In Xcode, select your device from the list of available devices in the top bar.
  
6. Press the "Play" button (or press Cmd+R) in the top left corner of Xcode to build and run the app. Xcode will install the app onto your device.
